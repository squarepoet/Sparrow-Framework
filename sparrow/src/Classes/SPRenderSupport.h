/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A class that contains helper methods simplifying OpenGL rendering.
 
 An SPRenderSupport instance is passed to any render: method. It saves information about the
 current render state, like the alpha value, modelview matrix, and blend mode.
 
 It also keeps a list of quad batches, which can be used to render a high number of quads
 very efficiently; only changes in the state of added quads trigger OpenGL draw calls.
 
 Furthermore, several static helper methods can be used for different needs whenever some
 OpenGL processing is required.

/// @name Methods
/// -------------

/// Resets the render state stack to the default.
- (void)nextFrame;

/// Adds a quad or image to the current batch of unrendered quads. If there is a state change,
/// all previous quads are rendered at once, and the batch is reset. Note that the values for
/// alpha and blend mode are taken from the current render state, not the quad.
- (void)batchQuad:(SPQuad *)quad;

/// Adds a batch of quads to the current batch of unrendered quads. If there is a state
/// change, all previous quads are rendered at once.
///
/// @note Copying the contents of the QuadBatch to the current "cumulative" batch takes some time.
/// If the batch consists of more than just a few quads, you may be better off calling the
/// "renderWithMatrix" method on the batch instead. Otherwise, the additional CPU effort will be
/// more expensive than what you save by avoiding the draw call. (Rule of thumb: no more than
/// 16-20 quads.)
- (void)batchQuadBatch:(SPQuadBatch *)quadBatch;

/// Renders the current quad batch and resets it.
- (void)finishQuadBatch;

/// Clears all vertex and index buffers, releasing the associated memory. Useful in low-memory
/// situations. Don't call from within a render method!
- (void)purgeBuffers;

/// Clears OpenGL's color buffer.
- (void)clear;

/// Clears OpenGL's color buffer with a specified color.
- (void)clearWithColor:(uint)color;

/// Clears OpenGL's color buffer with a specified color and alpha.

/// Checks for an OpenGL error. If there is one, it is logged an the error code is returned.
+ (uint)checkForOpenGLError;

/// Raises the number of draw calls by a specific value. Call this method in custom render methods
/// to keep the statistics display in sync.
- (void)addDrawCalls:(NSInteger)count;

/// Sets up the projection matrices for 2D and 3D rendering.
///
/// The first 4 parameters define which area of the stage you want to view. The camera
/// will 'zoom' to exactly this region. The perspective in which you're looking at the
/// stage is determined by the final 3 parameters.
///
/// The stage is always on the rectangle that is spawned up between x- and y-axis (with
/// the given size). All objects that are exactly on that rectangle (z equals zero) will be
/// rendered in their true size, without any distortion.

/// @name State Manipulation
/// ------------------------

/// Adds a new render state to the stack. The passed matrix is prepended to the modelview matrix;
/// the alpha value is multiplied with the current alpha; the blend mode replaces the existing

/// @name 3D Transformations
/// ------------------------

/// Prepends translation, scale and rotation of an object to the 3D modelview matrix. The current

/// --------------
/// @name Clipping
/// --------------

/// The clipping rectangle can be used to limit rendering in the current render target to a certain

/// intersected with the previous rectangle; the method returns that intersection.

/// Restores the clipping rectangle that was last pushed to the stack.
- (void)popClipRect;

/// Updates the scissor rectangle using the current clipping rectangle. This method is called
/// automatically when either the projection matrix or the clipping rectangle changes.
- (void)applyClipRect;

/// -------------------
/// @name Stencil Masks
/// -------------------

/// Draws a display object into the stencil buffer, incrementing the buffer on each used pixel. The
/// stencil reference value is incremented as well; thus, any subsequent stencil tests outside of
/// this area will fail.
///
/// If 'mask' is part of the display list, it will be drawn at its conventional stage coordinates.
/// Otherwise, it will be drawn with the current modelview matrix.
- (void)pushMask:(SPDisplayObject *)mask;

/// Redraws the most recently pushed mask into the stencil buffer, decrementing the buffer on each
/// used pixel. This effectively removes the object from the stencil buffer, restoring the previous
/// state. The stencil reference value will be decremented.
