/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An SPStage is the root of the display tree. It represents the rendering area of the application.
 
 Sparrow will create the stage for you. The root object of your game will be the first child of
 the stage. You can access `root` and `stage` from any display object using the respective 
 properties. 
 
 The stage's `width` and `height` values define the coordinate system of your game. The color
 of the stage defines the background color of your game.
